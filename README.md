# Bì Shēng

Bì Shēng is an unofficial mobile app for [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/), partly because I wanted one for the cheap Kindle Fire I bought and partly to test out the ecosystem.

## Naming

The original [Bì Shēng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_Sheng) (AD990-1051), a Chinese commoner who invented movable type in the 1040s, over four hundred years before [Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg).  Because of the similarity of Bì's story and his unfortunate obscurity (at least in the West), it seemed like an appropriate name for an app that interacts with Project Gutenberg.
